`Git-tturami` is programming study group in Chung-Ang university computer science engineering.<br>
We pursue study for <b>Mutual Benefit.</b> so, <b>Feel free 
This repository is for algorithm study.<br>

## For uploading your code
* Please make <b>your own directory</b> and push your codes.<br>
* Upload your code after naming with `(ploblem's no)-(ploblem's name).cpp` like `1000-add.cpp`.<br>
* Make <b>Pull request</b>, and our member will review your code.<br>

## Small rules for our study
* <b>Review other's code actively!!</b>
* Write commit-msg so we can understand well.
* When you write comment in your Pull request, you should include about below ones,
  * My code's abstract `Time complexity`.
  * My code's abstract `Space complexity`.
  * What `algorithm`, `data structures` or `ways` I used.
